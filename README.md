Implementing neural networks from papers or experimenting with own ideas often includes writing some boiler plate code. You can think of the `epoch for loop`, `evaluation round`, and `saving` the model. This package has some standard functions so that you can focus all your time on modelling and experimenting.

For now, the package is only tested and is focused on neural networks with Pytorch. Hence, the preferred language is Python.
